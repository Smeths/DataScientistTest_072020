Data Scientist test
================

## Overview

This repository contains data and instructions for test during
application

## The task

The task in this assessment is: ***build the best model you can, to
predict the ‘Death’ column in the dataset.***

We will not restrict you to particular model classes, statistical
paradigm, or set of assumptions you use. Please consider providing:

  - Some exploratory analyses and visualisations of the data items
  - Statistical / machine learning models to predict the ‘Death’ field
  - A method of assessing how ‘good’ a model is, and how you select the
    ‘best’ model
  - Interpretation of the model outputs

We advise you to spend no more than a couple of hours on this test, as
it is only part of the selection process. As such, we ask you to leave
any partial code/documents you create, even if they are incomplete, for
discussion at interview. This allows us to see your thought process, as
there are many ways to approach this exercise.
